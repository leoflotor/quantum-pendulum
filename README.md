# quantum-pendulum
Analysis of the behavior of a quantum pendulum. I apologize for not opening the project, I will release it when it is done.

The purpose of this package is to compute numerical solutions to the quantum pendulum using a [...] .

Due to the problems found by using the implementations in scipy.special of Mathieu's function, characteristic values and Fourier coefficients, my own implementation is also included here.
